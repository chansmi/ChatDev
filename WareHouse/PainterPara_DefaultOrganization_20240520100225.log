According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "our decision is to develop the new virtual painting studio application as a standalone desktop application".

Programming Language: "The message is about Python."

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via The message is about Python.. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[2024-20-05 10:02:55 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To get started, we will set up a main file named "painting_studio.py" as the central hub of our program. This file will handle initializing the graphical user interface (GUI) and managing user interactions. Here's an overview of what the main file will contain:

The code entails importing essential modules and libraries, creating the main application window with tkinter, and including a canvas for drawing. It sets up options for brush size and color using Scale and OptionMenu widgets. The `draw` function is responsible for responding to mouse events on the canvas by generating oval shapes based on the selected brush size and color.

To operate the application, you can run the "painting_studio.py" file with a Python interpreter. This will launch the virtual painting studio application, enabling users to sketch on the canvas using various brush sizes and colors.

It's important to recognize that this is a basic version of the virtual painting studio application. You have the opportunity to enhance it further by incorporating features such as saving and loading artwork, adding diverse brush types, and integrating advanced drawing tools.
