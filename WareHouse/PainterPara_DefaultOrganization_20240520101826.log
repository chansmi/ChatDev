ChatDev has made products in the following form before:

Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.

Document: can present information via .docx files.

PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.

Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.

PDF: can present information via .pdf files.

Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.

Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.

Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.

Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?

Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

[2024-20-05 10:18:37 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 I, as the Chief Product Officer, recommend developing the virtual painting studio app separately for desktop and mobile. This will allow users to easily access the app on their preferred devices, enhancing creativity on the go. By creating a standalone app, we can ensure a smooth user experience with tailored features for digital painting, including various brushes, colors, and a digital canvas. Leveraging modern device capabilities like touchscreens and styluses will provide a more engaging and realistic painting experience, along with advanced tools like layers and undo/redo for artists of all levels. Considering user needs and the app's requirements, I propose moving forward with this standalone format for the virtual painting studio app.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and some creative brainstorm ideas listed below: 

Task: "Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks.".

Modality: "i, as the chief product officer, recommend developing the virtual painting studio app separately for desktop and mobile this will allow users to easily access the app on their preferred devices, enhancing creativity on the go by creating a standalone app, we can ensure a smooth user experience with tailored features for digital painting, including various brushes, colors, and a digital canvas leveraging modern device capabilities like touchscreens and styluses will provide a more engaging and realistic painting experience, along with advanced tools like layers and undo/redo for artists of all levels considering user needs and the app's requirements, i propose moving forward with this standalone format for the virtual painting studio app".

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.
