Here is an example of how the code for the virtual painting studio application could be structured:

**main.py**

```python
'''
Main file for the virtual painting studio application.
'''

import tkinter as tk
from canvas import Canvas

def main():
    # Create the main application window
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Virtual Painting Studio")

    # Create a canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(root)

    # Run the application
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**canvas.py**

```python
'''
Canvas module for the virtual painting studio application.
'''

import tkinter as tk

class Canvas(tk.Canvas):
    def __init__(self, master, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(master, *args, **kwargs)
        self.bind("<Button-1>", self.start_drawing)
        self.bind("<B1-Motion>", self.draw)
        self.bind("<ButtonRelease-1>", self.stop_drawing)
        self.drawing = False
        self.current_brush = None
        self.create_blank_canvas()

    def create_blank_canvas(self):
        self.config(bg="white", width=800, height=600)

    def start_drawing(self, event):
        self.drawing = True

    def draw(self, event):
        if self.drawing and self.current_brush:
            x, y = event.x, event.y
            self.create_oval(x - self.current_brush.size, y - self.current_brush.size,
                             x + self.current_brush.size, y + self.current_brush.size,
                             fill=self.current_brush.color, outline=self.current_brush.color)

    def stop_drawing(self, event):
        self.drawing = False

class Brush:
    def __init__(self, size, color):
        self.size = size
        self.color = color
```

This is just a basic example to demonstrate the structure of the code. You can further expand and customize the application based on your requirements, adding features such as brushes, colors, undo/redo functionality, saving/loading artwork, and more.

Remember to install any necessary dependencies, such as the tkinter library, before running the application.

Paraphrased Message:
Here is a sample structure for the code of a virtual painting studio application:

In the **main.py** file, you'll find the code responsible for creating the main window of the application, initializing the canvas object, and running the application loop. 
Meanwhile, in the **canvas.py** file, you'll see the implementation of the Canvas class, which defines the canvas behavior like drawing, starting/stopping drawing, and managing brushes. 
This code example is a basic demonstration, and you can customize and enhance the application by adding features like brush types, colors, undo/redo actions, saving/loading artwork, and more. Don't forget to install any required dependencies, such as the tkinter library, before launching the application.
