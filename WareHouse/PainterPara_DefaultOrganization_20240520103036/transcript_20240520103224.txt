Please note that the code provided is a basic skeleton to get started with the implementation of the virtual painting studio application. You will need to fill in the missing functionality and implement the user interface using a GUI framework of your choice, such as tkinter, Pygame, or PyQt. Additionally, you may need to add additional classes and methods to support features like brush customization, layer management, and saving/loading artwork.

Paraphrased Message:
The code provided is a basic structure for a virtual painting studio application. You need to complete the missing parts and create a user interface using a GUI framework like tkinter, Pygame, or PyQt. You might also need to add more classes and methods for features such as brush customization, layer management, and saving/loading artwork.
