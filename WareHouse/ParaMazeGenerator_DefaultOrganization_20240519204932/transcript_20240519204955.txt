As the Chief Technology Officer, I agree with your suggestion to use Python for developing the maze generator application. Python's versatility, ease of use, and extensive library support make it an excellent choice for this project. The availability of libraries like Pygame, Pyglet, and the turtle module will simplify the maze generation process and allow for the creation of a graphical user interface.

Python's simplicity and readability will also facilitate collaboration among the development team, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase as needed. Additionally, Python's large and active community ensures that there are ample resources and support available for any challenges that may arise during the development process.

Overall, using Python as the programming language for the maze generator application aligns well with the project requirements and will enable us to deliver a high-quality and user-friendly solution to our customer.
