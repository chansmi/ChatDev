Here is a new customer's task: Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Product Officer, I believe it is important to consider the user's needs and the feasibility of the product format. 

Given the task of designing a virtual painting studio application, we need to choose a format that allows users to have a digital canvas, a variety of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to create digital artworks.

Considering the requirements, I propose that the product format should be a standalone application. This will provide users with a dedicated platform where they can have a seamless and immersive experience while painting digitally.

A standalone application will allow us to leverage the full potential of the user's device, providing a rich and interactive interface for creating digital artworks. It will also enable us to offer advanced features such as layers, blending modes, and various brush settings to enhance the user's creative process.

Additionally, a standalone application will provide offline functionality, allowing users to work on their digital artworks even without an internet connection. This will ensure that users can access and use the application anytime and anywhere, without any limitations.

Considering the user's needs and the feasibility of development, I propose that the chosen product format for the virtual painting studio application should be a standalone application.
