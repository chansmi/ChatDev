[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Thank you for considering my recommendation. I agree with your decision to use Python as the programming language for developing the virtual painting studio application. Python, along with libraries like Tkinter, Pygame, or Kivy, will provide a solid foundation for creating an intuitive and feature-rich painting experience for users. With Python's simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, we can efficiently implement the digital canvas, brushes, and color selection features required for the application. Let's proceed with Python as the chosen programming language for this project.
