That's correct! The main.py file acts as the entry point for the application, while the canvas.py, brush.py, and color_picker.py files handle the specific functionalities of the virtual painting studio application.

The canvas.py file defines the Canvas class, which is responsible for creating and managing the digital canvas. It includes methods for drawing on the canvas and clearing it.

The brush.py file contains the Brush class, which manages the brushes used in the application. It includes methods for changing the brush size and color.

The color_picker.py file implements the ColorPicker class, which provides a color selection interface for the user. It includes a method for picking a color and updating the brush color accordingly.

These files work together to create a user-friendly and feature-rich virtual painting studio application. Remember to install the necessary libraries (Tkinter, Pygame, or Kivy) using pip before running the application.
