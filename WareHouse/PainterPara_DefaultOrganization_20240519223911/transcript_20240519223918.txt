You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a virtual painting studio application offering users a digital canvas, an array of brushes, and a diverse selection of colors to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest that we develop a standalone application for the virtual painting studio to provide users with a dedicated and immersive experience. This format will allow us to offer a wide range of features and functionalities specifically tailored for digital artwork creation. <INFO> Standalone application.
