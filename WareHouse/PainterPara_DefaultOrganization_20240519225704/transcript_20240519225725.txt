<INFO> Python.

Python is an excellent choice for developing a virtual painting studio application. It is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python offers a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged to create a user-friendly and interactive application.

Python's extensive library ecosystem includes libraries such as Tkinter, Pygame, and Kivy, which provide the necessary tools for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and handling user input. These libraries offer features like canvas widgets, event handling, and drawing capabilities, making them well-suited for implementing the digital canvas, brushes, and color selection functionality required for the painting studio application.

Additionally, Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, which can help streamline the development process and make it easier for the development team to collaborate. Its vast community support and extensive documentation also make it easier to find resources and resolve any issues that may arise during development.

Considering all these factors, Python is a suitable programming language for implementing the virtual painting studio application.
