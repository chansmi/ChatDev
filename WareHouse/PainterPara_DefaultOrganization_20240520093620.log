Thank you for your response. I appreciate your input on the format for the virtual painting studio application. After carefully considering all the suggestions, I'm pleased to announce that the chosen format for the new product will be "<INFO> Mobile Application".

A mobile application offers several advantages for a virtual painting studio. It provides users with the flexibility to create digital artworks on the go, anytime and anywhere. Additionally, a mobile application can leverage the capabilities of modern smartphones and tablets, such as touchscreens and stylus support, to enhance the user experience and mimic the feel of traditional painting.

By opting for a mobile application, we can also take advantage of various features like multi-touch gestures, real-time rendering, and seamless integration with other mobile functionalities like sharing and saving artwork.

I believe that a mobile application will provide the best platform for users to unleash their creativity and produce digital artworks. Our team will now proceed with the design and development of the virtual painting studio mobile application.

Thank you all for your valuable input and collaboration in reaching this decision. Let's now move forward with the next steps to bring this product to life.
